# AlfredThemes

These are themes I created for Alfred. You can find the theme folders [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e7pki2srlir0uq8/AAAassNJzf4KhjGWlZtdg4dia?dl=0). From there you can find the theme you like and download the `.alfredappearance` file.

**Note:** If you'd like all the themes, simply just click the green "Code" button above and select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu. If you don't see the green button, make sure you're on [this page](https://github.com/marlonjames71/AlfredThemes).
