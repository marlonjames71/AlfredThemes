# AlfredThemes

These are themes I created for Alfred. You can find the theme folders [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e7pki2srlir0uq8/AAAassNJzf4KhjGWlZtdg4dia?dl=0). From there you can find the theme you like and download the `.alfredappearance` file.

**Note:** If you'd like all the themes, simply just click the green "Code" button above and select "download zip".
